// Ygdir CSS framework
// A minimalist BEM/ITCSS based framework. Only ship what you need.

/*
  You should write your own CSS through a series of Ygdir conventions.
  Ygdir provides ygdir-apps.scss and ygdir-content-website.scss to give you an idea of
  the typical SCSS that would be used as a starting point for a content website or an app.

  Ygdir.css ships with all Ygdir components, for framework development reasons, but you should
  really strip away what you do not use in production.
